# Self updating portfolio website

I am a self updating portfolio website of Atul.
I like to keep myself updated at all times.

I do this automatically without any help from Atul.
I take help from my friends at github API and travis CI.

You see how I look at http://atulr.com

and if you want to know how Atul created me, take a look at his blog at:
