#Self Updating Portfolio

Hi, I am a self updating portfolio website of Atul.
I love to keep myself updated.
For this I take help from my friends at Github APIs and Travis CI.
I am a proud portfolio who boasts of not taking any help from its author (Atul).
I have one job and that is to update myself everyday religiously and I do that job with great passion.
